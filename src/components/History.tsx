            Jahapur Secondary School, located in Jahapur village of Babuganj upazila of Barisal district, was established in 1969 and has been playing an important role in the development of education, morality and human values for a long time. However, for former students, Jahapur Secondary School is not just the name of an educational institution - it is a childhood memory, a dream of adolescence and an inspiration for the right path in life. Numerous students from this renowned educational institution have passed the SSC/Matriculation examination with distinction, obtained higher degrees from various educational institutions and are engaged in various professions in the country and abroad and are performing their duties with distinction. Many of them are already living a retired life, many former students have already passed away, and some are currently in search of employment.

            Even after more than half a century of its establishment, no effective organization has been formed for the welfare of this beloved school or to bring the students who grew up from here on the same platform. Starting from the very beginning, in an effort to ensure the welfare of the alumni, improve the quality of education of the currently studying talented, indigent and backward students, create opportunities for modern technology and technical training, and create a strong spiritual bond among all, along with the overall welfare of the teachers and students of the school, steps were taken to form the Alumni Association on the initiative of some alumni of different batches of this school. Initially, in order to institutionalize this initiative, several online and in-person meetings were held with alumni representatives of different batches, and activities were taken to collect information and formulate a constitution, including campaigning among the alumni regarding the establishment of the organization. As per the decision of the said meetings, a convening committee consisting of 9 (nine) members was formed on 28 November 2025 to give organizational form to the Alumni Association.The formed convening committee formed a constitution formulation committee consisting of 7 (seven) members on 28 November 2025 to formulate the constitution. Meanwhile, the demand for the formation of the Alumni Association was strengthened through social media such as WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook groups and the alumni spontaneously expressed great interest in this matter along with providing information. As a positive and subsequent result of this, the "Jahapur Secondary School Alumni Association - JSSAA" emerged with the slogan 'Let bonds be strength, let memories be motivation'. This Alumni Association remembers with deep respect all the individuals concerned who played an important role in the establishment and development of this school.
